    "*Vovochka breaks the Pentagon's security system. To do this, he needed to find out which characters in secret encrypted messages are used more often than others. For ease of study, Vovochka wants to get a graphical representation of the occurrence of characters. So he wants to build a histogram of the number of characters in the message. A histogram is a graph in which each character that occurs at least once in a message has a bar whose height is proportional to the number of those characters in the message.*\n",

It contains lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, numbers, punctuation marks (\".\", \"!\", \"?\", \":\", \"-\", \",\", \";\", \"(\", \")\"), spaces and newlines. The size of the input file does not exceed 10000 bytes. The text contains at least one non-whitespace character. All lines of the input file are no longer than 200 characters. For each c character, except for spaces and newlines, output a column of \"#\" characters, the number of which must be equal to the number of c characters in the given text. Under each column, write the symbol corresponding to it. Format the bar chart so that the bottom ends of the bars are on the same line, the first row and the first column are non-blank. Do not separate columns from each other. Sort the columns in ascending order of character codes.*\n",
